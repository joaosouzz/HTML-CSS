                <h2>Cyberpunk</h2>
                <p>In the neon-lit streets of the megacity, rain fell steadily, mixing with the hum of digital billboards and the constant buzz of hovercars. The air was thick with smog, and the city's skyline seemed to stretch endlessly upward, disappearing into a haze of pollution and light.

                <h2>Cyberpunk genre</h2>
                <p>Cyberpunk is a genre that blends futuristic technology with dystopian society, often set in sprawling cities under a constant glow of neon lights. It’s a world where high-tech innovations coexist with social decay, and where hackers, rebels, and outcasts navigate through the shadows of towering skyscrapers. With its focus on corporate control, artificial intelligence, and human augmentation, cyberpunk explores themes of identity, freedom, and survival in a world where humanity is increasingly intertwined with machines.</p>
